// 1 Write reverseArray function that takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order.

console.log(reverseArray(["A", "B", "C"]));

// 2 Write reverseArrayInPlace function, which modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements.

console.log(reverseArrayInPlace([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));

// Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one runs faster?
