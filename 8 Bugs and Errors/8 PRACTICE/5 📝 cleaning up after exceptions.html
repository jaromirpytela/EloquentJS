<!--
Say you want to send amount of money from your account "a" to a recipient. Create an object with my and recipients accounts and write transfer function that asks for the name of the other account in the process by calling getAccount. If given an invalid account name, getAccount throws an exception. Transfer first removes the money from your account, and then calls getAccount before it adds it to recipients account. Try block may be followed by a finally block either instead of or in addition to a catch block.
