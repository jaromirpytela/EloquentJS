/*
The Set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does not associate other values with those - it just tracks which values are part of the set. A value can only be part of a set once. Write class called Group. Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. 1) Add from method to prototype and test the methods on [10,20] array. 2) Make the Group class iterable and iterate through "a", "b", "c" array and display the letters.
