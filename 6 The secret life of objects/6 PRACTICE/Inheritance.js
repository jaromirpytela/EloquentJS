/*Inside class methods, super provides a way to call methods as
they were defined in the superclass. The set method again uses super
to call a specific method from the superclass’ set of methods. We are
redefining set, but do want to use the original behavior. Inside class
methods, super provides a way to call methods as they were defined in
the superclass.*/
