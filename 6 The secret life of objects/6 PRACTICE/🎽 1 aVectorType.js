/* Write a class Vec that represents a 2D vector. It takes x and y same name. Give the Vec prototype two methods, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has 1) the sum or 2) difference of the two vectors’ x and y values. 3) add a getter property length that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance from the origin.
